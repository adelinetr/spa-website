# Tranquility Spa Website 

I've started studying web-development on my own in October and this project was made in January. 
It was amongst the first works I've made to start practicing one-page websites, so main thing I focused on was implementing different designs and learning more about use of flexbox.

## Mock-up with Logo
At this period I was also curious about graphic design, so many logos I tried to do myself to expand my understanding of design from multiple areas. Here I
 used a template from Freepik to play with visual understanding and overall feeling of this brand.
